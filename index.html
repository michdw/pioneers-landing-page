        I'm going to Southeast Asia to help reached the unreached with the gospel through mobile apps!

      <p>
        Years ago, I started teaching myself how to write code and create websites, a path that eventually led to my current job as a programmer with a large banking company. In that time, my love for coding has stayed with me, but I've increasingly felt the need to use my skills for something that I believe in.
      </p>
      <p>
        Late last year, I started reaching out to missions orgs to see if anyone could use a programmer in a short term role. My search was remarkably short, as it turned out the organization <a href="https://pioneers org" target="_blank">Pioneers</a> was looking for tech interns to do exactly what I was interested in. After completing the application process, attending an orientation at the Pioneers US base, and meeting my prospective team members online, I'm now slated to travel to Thailand in August and spend about four months working with a small team of software developers on the field.
      </p>
      <p>
        The mission of Pioneers is to initiate church planting movements among unreached people groups, where few if any people know Christ or have a Christian witness in their lives. Working with technology doesn't accomplish this in itself, but it has become important to missions in this part of the world, where many people have access to a smartphone even if they don't know any Christians.
      </p>
      <p>
        My team develops apps based on requests from missionaries working directly with unreached people groups. These apps serve as a way of sharing scripture, Bible stories and worship songs, emphasizing audio and visual content in order to be accessible to people with limited reading ability. The team has already produced apps that are now in use among <a href="https://lambardu.org/en/app/" target="_blank">Tibetan,</a> <a href="https://www.nobleescaperoute.com/" target="_blank">Burmese,</a> and <a href="https://apkpure.com/rah%C3%A1motor-rasta-rohingya/com.rohingyarr.app" target="_blank">Rohingya</a> peoples.
      </p>
      <p>
        My primary job will be helping the team build an admin website, which will make it easier for missionaries to customize and manage the apps themselves. I'll also have a chance to experience a new culture, be involved in local ministries and get an up-close look at missions in a part of the world where Christianity is still largely unknown.

      As of this writing (June 2025), I am already fully planning on going to Thailand, but the trip does carry a significant financial cost, and I am praying for others who feel led to help support me. I'm also hoping to continue this work in some way after my initial trip is over, and the level of interest and support I get for this trip will go a long way in helping me determine how much I can stay involved. I'm grateful for any level of support, and for your prayers.

      I'm planning on sending semi-regular email updates to my supporters and anyone interested in learning more&mdash; if you change your mind, you'll be able to unsubscribe directly from the emails at any time. I would also be happy to keep in touch (contact info will be shared with subscribers!)
